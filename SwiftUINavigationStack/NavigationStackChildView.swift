//  Description:
//  A lightweight wrapper view that delays rendering of its content,
//  typically used to avoid visual glitches during navigation transitions.
//  Helps ensure smoother push/pop animations by deferring UI updates
//  until the transition has completed.
//

/// A wrapper that waits before showing its content, giving time for navigation animations to finish.
struct NavigationStackChildView<Content: View>: View {
    @EnvironmentObject private var navigationStack: NavigationStackManager

    let content: () -> Content

    /// Create a view that shows its content after a short wait (default is 0.25s).
